                        <p>Welcome to aki.guide! Dedicated to sharing knowledge about the wrestling games produced by AKI Corporation between 1996 and 2007. The primary focus is currently on the six games released on the Nintendo 64. In the last few years, the community has released several variations on those original releases, that are playable on actual Nintendo 64 hardware. I’d like to see even more people building their own community releases, and having a central source of knowledge to build from can go a long way towards that.</p>

<p>We have Discord channels, old forums locked in archive mode or fallen out of usage, and bits and pieces of information scattered to the internet winds. I still believe that the only way to share knowledge is somewhere centralized, and clearly defined.</p>

<p>My hope with aki.guide is to gather this knowledge somewhere it can be stored and shared to others, so that anyone with the drive to can create their own releases for the Nintendo 64. Toward that end, this site is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and comprised primarily of flat file <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> text documents. If I go away, or this site goes away, the information remains behind, and in a place anyone can get to and backup, and hopefully carry on the finding and sharing of that information.</p>

<p>Hosting on GitHub via flat files also keeps the costs down and the management to a minimum. I only have to pay to keep the domain name.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, there’s self-interest here too. I’m trying to produce my own community release for the N64, and combing through this knowledge will only make that easier to accomplish. Recently, I even figured out how to <a href="../../posts/custom-costume-memory-addresses-wm2k/">pull custom costume strings from Wrestlemania 2000’s Edit mode</a> for replacement.</p>
