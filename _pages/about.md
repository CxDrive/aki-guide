aki.guide is dedicated to sharing knowledge about the wrestling games produced by AKI Corporation between 1996 and 2007 with a primary focus currently on the six games released on the Nintendo 64. In the last few years, the community has released several variations on those original releases, that are playable on actual Nintendo 64 hardware. I'd like to see even more people building their own community releases, and having a central source of knowledge to build from can go a long way towards that.

aki.guide is built and managed by C-Drive.
