> Right, here is V2. It's called AKI Animation Calculator. You can use it to import moves into other AKI Wrestling Games and you can use it as a Toki Tool. It basically calculates everything for you. All you have to do is to select the game and enter the animation value and KAPOOYA! You have all your Toki 1, 2 and 3 Addresses, Values, ROM addresses and length of animation (So you know how many bytes of data you need to select when importing an animation). It will even compile the code for you (only for Toki 2 and Toki 3), so all you have to do is copy and paste it into your emulator. I've tried to make as easy as possible for everyone. For the Toki 1 addresses in the green box, you'll need to add the values yourself as the values aren't the same across all games.

> All addresses and values relate to the unmodified/unhacked ROMs, and hopefully they're all correct. The only thing that I'm a bit iffy on are the VPW64 Toki 1 addresses. They seem to be shorter than the other games.
