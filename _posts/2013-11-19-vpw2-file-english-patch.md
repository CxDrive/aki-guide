> - Hidden moves highlighted in different colours. Hidden WCW moves in yellow, Hidden WWF moves in red and other hidden moves in green
> - Moves under the timer on the results screen have been translated

> Enjoy the patch guys, and hopefully we should be able to see some saves being made for VPW2. Oh, and I'm also going to try and edit the appearances of the unlicensed guys...somehow...but that'll be once the patch is completed.
