okay people
I spent the last half hour getting through maybe the first half of the process
here's a very attractive man

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_01.webp){:.centered-img}

we're going to use him as our reference today
this is a somewhat less attractive man

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_02.webp){:.centered-img}

he will also be our reference today
Step one is going to be to resize the above image such that it fits within Shaman's frame
like so

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_03.webp){:.centered-img}

next, we're going to create some LINE ART
which is a technical term for "I'm going to trace this to the best of my ability, please don't laugh"

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_04.webp){:.centered-img}

you will usually need one layer of transparency to do the line art, and one white layer underneath to check your work
this line art is a decent enough basis to begin what I call the 'thiccening"
yummy

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_05.webp){:.centered-img}

now what we've done here is copy the same layer on top of itself several times over
making minor adjustments and shaving away blotches
that way we have a cleaner, but better-defined frame within which we can start coloring
this part is relatively straightforward
you can spend as much time here as you want, but you should generally accept when you're done
uh oh I made a mess

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_06.webp){:.centered-img}

OR DID I

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_07.webp){:.centered-img}

you'll take whatever Shaman's darkest skintone is to create your basecoat
this is going to make it much easier for you to begin adding on the gradients
I'm going to skip the next few, you'll understand what I did
now this is going to look a little weird, but I assure you, this will make sense

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_08.webp){:.centered-img}

once you've applied enough layers, blur it

gaussian's not really necessary
after making further adjustments with the highlights and creating separate layers for hair color and eye color, I landed on this

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_10.webp){:.centered-img}

and this is where I'll stop for now til I get time to finish it up
hopefully this makes sense to all of you

okay folks, I rushed through the last of it
it's not perfect, but here we go
I'm going to assume you know how to clean up the edges
you should have a cache of backgrounds to use from the existing characters; I'm going to use this one

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_11.webp){:.centered-img}

this is what we have right now

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_12.webp){:.centered-img}

now what you're going to want to do is copy your line art and invert it
very slowly and gently, with a soft edge eraser, erase this

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_13.webp){:.centered-img}

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_14.webp){:.centered-img}

then you're going to want to copy the entire image (underneath this white line art layer), and invert it + colorize it to a deeper color (in this case blue)
Make sure to use LINEAR invert by the way
pre-colorization

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_15.webp){:.centered-img}

colorized

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_16.webp){:.centered-img}

set your brush to a big size and to an opacity of about 30
and start gently erasing
I can't teach this, you're going to have to get a feel for it
but basically try and follow the edges of his face
to contour his existing features
you end up with this

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_17.webp){:.centered-img}

do some final cleanup of the edges, apply the background, create a new layer from visible
and apply the palette...

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_18.webp){:.centered-img}

could be better, but I think that's world record time for me (one hour?)

and the tweaking never stops from there, whether others notice or not

![Screenshot](../../assets/img/{{ page.assetid }}_19.webp){:.centered-img}

(it stops for this one though 'cause I'll never use it)

just so everyone doesn't just keep using that blue background, here are some others you can use:
