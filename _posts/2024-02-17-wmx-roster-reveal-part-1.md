### Video Description


> My current mods can be found and patched at [https://patcher.aki.guide/](https://patcher.aki.guide/)
>
> So here is the first official roster reveal video for Wrestlemania X, an upcoming N64 mod for Wrestlemania 2000 focusing at a time around the attitude era.  I consider all these characters finished, meaning that their movesets, stats, logic, 4 outfits, themes, and placement in the rom is finished barring any changes.  I will release these videos as soon as I complete a "column" of characters.
>
> Bret Hart - He's pretty much ported from Revenge as is, although his 2nd and 4th outfits have older side stripe tights.
>
> Lex Luger - Also ported from Revenge.  It should be noted that although the USA tights are from Revenge as is, I did edit a Union Jack variation for a certain powerful ally of his.
>
> Yokozuna - Perhaps the hardest character to figure out.  Mostly because WM2000 doesn't have the best body types for giant characters.  However, I don't think it came out too bad, and Yokozuna is a character I really wanted to have, since he was one of the major antagonists for the era.
>
> Undertaker - Minimal changes from the WM2000 version.  However I did have to edit a classic button shirt and port the UT Boots to get a better classic look.
>
> Shawn Michaels - Now on the surface, he looks to be a port, but there was some stuff I changed.  He only had the DX style tights in WM2000, so I ported the classic tights from No Mercy.  His moveset has also been altered, including a new animation for his Teardrop Back Suplex by Krayzie2k99.  He also has his older theme song...and maybe in the future a manager reveal as well.
>
> Razor Ramon - Another port from Revenge, with tights from VPW Freem.
>
> Owen Hart - I really like how this one came out.  I made some nice lower tights for his King of Harts tights, as well as some retro style tights (that hint at two of his tag partners back then).
>
> I was having doubts about adding him in, but decided to since he was one of my favorite wrestlers back in the day, and my favorite storytelling from the New Generation was the Wrestlemania X Bret vs Owen match opening the PPV, and tearing the house down.  Then at the end of the night when Bret beats Yokozuna for the title, Owen is watching the celebration in anger.  It was just an amazing feud.
