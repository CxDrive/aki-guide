> Normally the game lets you select only certain numbers such as 8, 16, etc. It is possible however to use different ones. I've just found this useful addy:

    800AAABC

> The number of players is loaded there right after you select it.

##### So, if you use this code:

    810AAABC 0006

> you'll play a royal rumble match with 6 players

> I've also tried numbers such as the real royal rumble (30) and 50. I haven't completed the matches, but they seemed to work fine.

##### 30 players

    810AAABC 001E

##### 50 players

    810AAABC 0032


> I've used higher numbers (70), but the game crashed. I think you can try anything not too high and it should do it. Let me know if this works for you.
>
> Note: the numbers are in the hexadecimal format

> Update:

##### With 60 men it seems to work:

    810AAABC 003C

##### The maximum possible is 67:

    810AAABC 0043
