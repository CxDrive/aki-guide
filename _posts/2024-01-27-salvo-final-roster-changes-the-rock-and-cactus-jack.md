### Video Description


> The roster for Salvo has been finalized. You can expect it to be out in two weeks (February 11th, 2024) barring any serious issues that I haven't identified as of this writing.
>
> I did a few iterations of this match. The first, I won, but it wasn't very fun to watch so I scrapped it. The second was just plain challenging, but I still won. The problem was, the video ended up close to 18 minutes in length. Thus, for this video, I had to skip entrances and impose a 10 minute time limit. Weirdly enough, I feel like that made for something of a compelling story. I did feel like I was playing the heel dominating the match prior to Cactus Jack trying to make a desperate comeback. Hope you didn't find the draw too disappointing.
>
> Anyway, take a look below to see the roster details, straight from the README (that I am still in the middle of writing).
>
> The following people have been added to the roster, for the most part at the expense of the lost managers like Sister Sherri or "Ted Debisas":
> 1. Ric Flair (WCW 1)
> 2. nWo Sting (nWo White) - was already in-game, now restored with his own character slot and costume
> 3. Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF)
> 4. Shawn Michaels (WWF)
> 5. The Undertaker (WWF) - both Ministry Taker and the American Badass are featured; the former uses one of his two beta "Revenge-style" faces buried within WWF Wrestlemania 2000
> 6. The Rock (WWF) - like the Undertaker, he uses one of two beta faces buried within the ROM, though the one used is arguably better known and fits the notion of "Revenge-style"; replaces Sick Boy
> 7. Kane (WWF) - based on his WWF No Mercy attire, although the masks were custom-made by me to resemble his latter-half-of-2000 mask; the black mask is just so that you can freely give him something that's not red for an additional attire
> 8. Cactus Jack (WWF) - an unmasked 1996-era Mankind costume serves as his P2 costume, while Dude Love is his P3 costume; replaces Riggs
> 9. Wrath (WCW 2) - was already in-game, now with his own costume; Hawk and Animal are his P2 and P4 costumes respectively
> 10. Mitsuharu Misawa (AJPW) - uses his VPW64 moveset; doesn't replace AKI Man, if you're curious
> 11. Vader (AJPW) - uses his VPW64 moveset
>
>The WWF roster additions use movesets based on their WM2K movesets, while Vader and Misawa were better suited to using their VPW64 movesets, due to the similarity in styles and the large amount of moves already being present in Revenge.
>
>I had planned on keeping AKI Man around, but with the case of adding two new wrestlers, his being half Misawa when Misawa was already present, and with Sick Boy and Riggs already being so similar, it just made sense to convert AKI Man into shared Sick Boy/Riggs slot, though the height, weight, and moves all belong to Sick Boy. (Also note that I ran a survey on Twitter to confirm that people felt the same way, so it's not totally my fault, Flock fans).
>
> All the DAW and AJPW wrestlers have been recostumed to reflect who they're supposed to be. A lot of head reassignment had to be done to facilitate adding Ric Flair, Austin, HBK, Undertaker, and Kane into the game. Kawada, Kobashi, Taue, and Tenryu all share head definitions now, so technically you can just swap appearances between them willy-nilly.
>
> The following are costume replacements that you should know about, in case you consider alternate costumes to be additional characters, depending on the context:
> 1. Scott Norton - now only has his 'bald' hair style and uses a couple of other colors to round out his costumes; his 'two-head' head definition went to Scott Steiner
> 2. Scott Steiner - now only has the 'shades' head and his classic head, as his 'three-head' head definition went to Wrath; a white version of his already-present classic red outfit has been included
> 3. Billy Kidman - shares his 'seven-head' head definition with Juvi to facilitate the inclusion of Matt and Jeff Hardy (P4 and P2 respectively) as alternate costumes; Juvi loses some extra masks as a result
> 4. Worth stating here: La Parka also loses four masks to allow for Kane and Undertaker to have two heads each
> 5. Bret Hart - no longer has shades, as his 'two-head' head definition was given to Glacier
> 6. Glacier - now has Hiroshi Hase as P2 and P4
> 7. Wrath - now has Hawk and Animal as P2 and P4 respectively, and has a completely fixed moveset
> 8. Psychosis - now has Syxx in an nWo Hollywood t-shirt and jeans as a P4
> 9. Rey Mysterio - now has Great Sasuke (as he appeared in VPW64) and Taka Michinoku (as he appeared in VPW2, costume-corrected) as P3 and P4 respectively
> 10. Ultimo Dragon - no new characters per se, just a rather extreme makeover in line with what I'm relatively certain he was supposed to look like
> 11. Executioner - though he is now Kenta Kobashi, his P2 and P4 are now Jun Akiyama
> 12. Dr. Frank - though he is now Jumbo Tsuruta, his P2 is Stan Hansen, his P3 is Terry Gordy, and his P4 is Bruiser Brody.

### Comments & Replies

After working on Salvo, do you think there should be a revenge plus rom hack similar to no mercy plus ? Or are we already good to go?

> I don't think Revenge is conducive to a NM+ style project. It is by far the hardest game to hack for out of the three I've worked on. Part of that is because World Tour and Revenge don't really have community support (WWF WM2K is doing a lot better now than it was when I was working on SUMMIT, thankfully).
>
> Even if one were to make extra wrestlers available, I have my doubts that people are willing to learn how to build movesets and costumes using hex editors and spreadsheets. The character slots themselves don't really mean anything unless you know how to turn them into full characters.
