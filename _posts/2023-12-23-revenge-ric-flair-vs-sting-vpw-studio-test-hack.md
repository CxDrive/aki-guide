## Video Description

> Lots of movement in WCW/nWo Revenge recently. Once again, myself, freem, and Melonbread have put our heads together and made some massive strides in hacking this game.
>
> What you're seeing here is special for a few reasons:
>
> 1. Wrath was not the only lost character in Revenge; nWo Sting was in there the whole time as well, missing only his profile data and his costume textures (both of which I added to the game). His head data, moveset data, height data, and body type were all already present, and required change in ID4 to reenable.
> 2. Ric Flair is a completely custom character from the ground up. Custom textures, custom moveset, etc. Even the character he replaces (the "Manager" version of Eric Bischoff) doesn't share his ID. Ric Flair has his own ID that places him back within the WCW roster.
> 3. Neither character replaces a main roster character, as both replace managers. In Flair's case, as mentioned, he replaced Eric Bischoff the Manager, while Eric Bischoff the 'wrestler' remains intact. In nWo Sting's case, he replaces what remained of Sister Sherri/Sensational Sherri, who had no appearance data, nor any real moveset.
>
> nWo Sting's head does look functionally identical to the regular Crow Sting's head, but we know it's different because the textures and models are stored under different files to that of the regular Sting. Additionally, nWo Sting only has this one head, while the regular Sting has three (Wolfpac, Crow, and Surfer). His moveset is also similar to that of the normal Sting, but there are specific differences that point to nWo Sting's moveset being based on Sting's moveset from World Tour. Almost all of his grapples correspond to that version of Sting, and his parameters make reference to nWo members pre-Wolfpac split as rivals. The current working theory is that nWo Sting, like in World Tour, was meant to be a duplicate of the regular Sting. His moves and parameters possibly represent Sting as he was prior to May 1998 (i.e. before the Wolfpac was a thing). There is no mistaking that this moveset belonged to nWo Sting, as it was located in the portion of the filetable with wrestlers whose name begins with "N", appearing at the very end of the list.
>
> Ric Flair is very much like the Shawn Michaels from World Tour in terms of he was developed, and a large part of that is because Revenge and World Tour/VPW64 have very similar moveset formats. As a result, this version of Ric Flair is designed to resemble his World Tour counterpart to the nth degree. There are only a few deviations:
>
> 1. He's missing his World Tour taunt, which isn't in Revenge; instead he uses his intro taunt from World Tour as his main taunt.
> 2. The low blow kick counter he used in World Tour appears to be absent in Revenge, so I used the closest substitute.
> 3. He didn't have a corner taunt in World Tour, so I gave him the standard "rope grabbing" one Goldberg uses.
> 4. His spinning punch from World Tour is absent; nWo Sting uses the same move in World Tour, and uses the spinning punch in this game. Logic dictates that this spinning punch replaced the one from World Tour, so I used that as the replacement.
>
> Finally, I made sure to initialize the game so that you could see there was no trickery going on here. All of this is a ROM hack and is playable on a real console. That being said, as always: there is currently no plan to take this any further than I have.
